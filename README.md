Thinktecture.IdentityManager
============================

**current status: preview 1**

## Overview ##

IdMgr is a modern replacement for the ASP.NET WebSite Administration tool that used to be built into Visual Studio. It is meant to be a tool for developers and/or administrators to manage the identity information for users of their applications. This includes creating users, editing user information (passwords, email, claims, etc.) and deleting users.

IdMgr is designed as OWIN middleware and can be run in any OWIN host. Currently, MembershipReboot and ASP.NET Identity v2 are the supported identity management systems.

Future plans include role management as well as production deployment scenarios for administrators to manage their production users.
